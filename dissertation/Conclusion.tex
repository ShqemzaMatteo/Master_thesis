The aim of this dissertation is to explore the connection between the network's entropy and the random walk, especially the quantum version.

The network's entropy permit us to introduce an information theory for networks, considering not only the topological properties but also the dynamical aspects. 
In this work, we prove that formulation for the network's entropy can be obtain also starting from a dynamical problem: the quantum walk subjected to thermal noise.



This work is just a first step towards understanding the problem. There are still many obscure aspects of this model as dealing with systems that do not satisfy the detailed balance condition.

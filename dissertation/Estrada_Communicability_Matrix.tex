\chapter{Density Matrix and Entropy for Networks}

This chapter introduces this concept of density matrix and entropy for a network. We start form the concept of Communicability matrix defined by Estrada \cite{Estrada_2008} and how it is connected to the correlation in physics, especially for quantum systems. After that we use this matrix to define a possible candidate to the role of density matrix and its features. This approach makes use of quantities and techniques that were introduces for quantum many body and quantum computing, opening a connection between the network theory and quantum realm.

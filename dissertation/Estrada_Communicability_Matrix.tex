\chapter{Density Matrix and Entropy for Networks}\label{C_Density_Matrix}

In many complex system one element can be influenced by another ones with which is not directing interacting. For example, considering the city mobility, the road forms the network, closing one road may create traffic in another roads that do not intersect the closed one. To study the correlation between the nodes of a network the communicability matrix was introduced \cite{Estrada_2008}.
We call it communicability because correlation as a different meaning in social science, they called in this way the interactions.

Interestingly, this matrix behave as quantum density matrix. Thus, it is a possible candidate to the role of network density matrix and, as a consequence, we can borrow some information quantities as entropy that were introduces for quantum many body and quantum computing, opening a connection between the network theory and quantum realm.

\chapter{Density Matrix and Entropy for Networks}\label{C_Density_Matrix}

In many complex systems, one element can be influenced by others with which does not directly interact. For instance, considering the city mobility, the road forms a network, closing one road may create traffic in other roads that do not intersect the closed one. To study the correlations between the nodes of a network the communicability matrix was introduced \cite{Estrada_2008}. 
This matrix captures the way the information spreads across the network. Thus, it should depend on the dynamical aspects of the network.
We call it communicability because correlation as a different meaning in social science, where it typically describes interactions.

Interestingly, this matrix behave as quantum density matrix, making it is a possible candidate to the role of network's density matrix. As a consequence, we can introduce an entropy function analogous to the von Neumann entropy found in quantum many body and quantum computing, opening a connection between the network theory and quantum realm.

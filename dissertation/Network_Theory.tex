\chapter{Introduction to Network Theory}\label{Network_Theory}

In this chapter it is introduce the basic concept of the diffusion or random walk over a network and its connection with the density matrix proposed above.

Scientists use network to map the interaction between units. A lot of problem can be address using network like the road in a city, the internet and the social media, but also the interaction in a protein and the communication between neurons in the brain. 
Initially, the

%definition of network, adjacency matrix, laplacian matrix, shortest path, ...
The mathematical framework used in Network theory is given by Graph theory. 

A graph is defined by a ordinate couple $(V,E)$ where $V = \{1,2,3, ...,n\}$ is the set of nodes and $E = \left\{ (i, j): i , j \in V ; i \mathrm{\, is\, linked\, to\,} j\right\}$ is the set of links or edges. Usually, a general graph is called $G =(N,M)$ where $N$ and $M$ are respectively the cardinality of $V$ and $E$.

The graph can be view also via a matrix called Adjacency matrix defined as
\begin{equation}
    A_{ij}= \left\{ \begin{aligned}
        +1 &\quad \mathrm{if} \; i \; \mathrm{is ~linked ~to} \; j \\
        0 &\quad \mathrm{otherwise} \\
    \end{aligned} \right.  .
\end{equation}
The degree $d_i$ of a node $i$ is the number of nodes that are linked to it. It can be compute from the adjacency matrix as
\begin{equation}
    d_i = \sum_j A_{ij}
\end{equation}
We can defined $G' =(V',E')$ a subgraph of $G= (V,E)$ if $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.

Graphs can be grouped mainly into two type: \textit{undirected} and \textit{directed} graph. In the first one if the node $i$ is connected to $j$ then $j$ is connected to $i$, namely $(i, j) = (i, j)$; its adjacency matrix is symmetric.
In the second one, instead, if the node $i$ is connected to $j$ not necessary the inverse its true, namely $(i, j) \neq (i, j)$; its adjacency matrix is not symmetric.

An important concept is the study of the connection between nodes that are not linked together by an edge. As a matter of fact, two nodes can be connected also passing through multiple other nodes.
A \textit{walk} of length $k$ from node $i$ to node $j$ its a sequence of nodes $(x_0,x_1,...,x_k)$ that begins in node $x_0=i$ and ends in node $x_k=j$ such that $(x_l, x_{l+1}) \in E$, a node can be crossed multiple times.  
A walk where the nodes are crossed only one time is called path.
An important relevance has the \textit{shortest path} or \textit{geodesic} that is the path that cross the less number of nodes.  
The number of walks $W_{ij}(k)$ of length $k$ from node $i$ to node $j$ can be found using the adjacency matrix as
\begin{equation}
    W_{ij}(k) = (A^k)_{ij}
\end{equation}

A graph is said connected if for each couple of distinct nodes $i$ and $j$ exists a walk that connect them. 
A \textit{component} of a graph $G= (V,E)$ is a connected subgraph $G' =(V',E')$ that is connected to nothing else, that is $(i,j)\notin E$ for each $i\in V'$ and $j\in V\setminus V'$.
